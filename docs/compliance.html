			<h2 class="my-10 text-xl font-bold text-center text-yellow-600">Sponsoring international students</h2>
			<p class="my-6">
				One of the most serious lapses in trust between the agent and institution occurs through non-compliance with the
				current UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI) regulations. The ultimate responsibility for this lies with the
				institution, which must therefore be confident that as an agent you are knowledgeable and fully conversant with
				the codes and regulations.
			</p>
			<p class="my-6">
				UKVI codes and regulations are frequently changed or extended, so it is imperative that you keep fully updated
				and informed.
			</p>
			<p class="my-6">
				Universities must provide the UKVI with statistics including visa refusal rates, which must not exceed their
				‘tolerance threshold’.
			</p>
			<p class="my-6">Agents are expected to be completely honest, trustworthy and well-informed in this.</p>
			<p class="my-6">
				Schools, colleges or universities which are allowed by the UK Home Office to sponsor international students to
				study appear on the list of approved education providers (<a
					href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-students"
					target="_blank"
					class="text-yellow-600 underline hover:text-blue-500"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>Register of licensed sponsors</a
				>).
			</p>

			<p>
				All sponsors must work within the guidelines of the UKVI Policy and provide information to the Home Office about
				the international students applying and studying at their institution. If they do not report anything that they
				should, they may have their license suspended, and may lose it. The method and information to be reported
				changes periodically, reflecting changes in UK Government and UK Home Office policy. Sponsors must monitor and
				comply with these changes.
			</p>

			<h3 class="my-6 font-semibold text-center">Reporting includes all international students:</h3>

			<ul class="ml-5 list-disc">
				<li>Issued with a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)</li>
				<li>Studying on a course at the institution</li>
				<li>Studying on a course with a partner institution (named on the CAS)</li>
				<li>Undertaking a work placement as part of the course of study</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="my-6">They must also give information on the agents used to recruit the students.</p>

			<h3 class="my-6 font-semibold text-center">Protecting students’ Student status</h3>

			<p>
				To protect their Student status, you and your students must be aware of their institution’s ‘reporting’
				responsibilities. As an agent you should inform the institution of any changes you are aware of in the student’s
				or prospective student’s circumstances. Students must make sure that they too are complying with all their
				responsibilities to be a ‘good student’.
			</p>

			<h2 class="my-10 text-xl font-bold text-center text-yellow-600">Genuine students</h2>
			<p>
				For an international student to gain a successful result from their course and period of study they will need to
				have the necessary capacity and resources. These include both educational background and material resource and
				support. The student’s intention is for a temporary stay in the UK to achieve their educational qualification.
				Institutions may want to interview the student.
			</p>

			<p>
				Institutions are only allowed to accept and issue a CAS to ‘genuine students’, and UKVI places duties and
				responsibilities on them to ensure this is the case. For a CAS to be issued the student must:
			</p>

			<ul class="ml-5 list-disc">
				<li class="my-4">
					Have met all of the academic entry requirements for the course, including level of English language and
					academic qualifications
				</li>
				<li class="my-4">Hold an unconditional offer from the institution and</li>
				<li class="my-4">Have accepted this offer of study</li>
				<li class="my-4">Be able and likely to complete the course of study</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="my-6">In addition, the course must represent ‘academic progress’ for the student.</p>

			<p class="my-6">For a course to represent academic progress from previous study, the course must:</p>

			<ul class="ml-5 list-disc">
				<li class="my-4">
					Be above the level of the previous course for which the applicant was granted leave as a Student.
				</li>
				<li class="my-4">
					Involve further study at the same level, which the Student Sponsor confirms as complementing the previous
					course for which the applicant was granted leave as a Student.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="my-6">
				Sponsors must also assess whether the visa and immigration leave requested now will lead to the student
				exceeding the three-year limit on courses below degree level or the five-year cap on courses at degree level.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				In addition, all sponsors must ensure that sponsored students are academically engaging throughout the period of
				leave for which they are being sponsored. A student is academically engaging if they are actively and
				consistently following their course of study
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				This new academic engagement policy for higher education providers replaces the

			<h2 class="my-10 text-xl font-bold text-center text-yellow-600">Introduction to Credibility Interviews</h2>
			<p>
				The Home Office have introduced credibility interviews into the Student visa application process. However, if
				the student is a low risk national they may not be called for interview.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				There are two types of credibility interview. The first type will take place at the same time as their
				biometrics are taken at the Embassy or designated agency. This initial interview will only take around five
				minutes and will be via video link with the Home Office in the UK. The purpose of the interview is to check the
				student’s credibility as a genuine student and the focus of this interview will be their reasons for choosing
				the UK, the University and the programme of study as well as questions on the content of their course.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				The Home Office will record the interview and send a summary to the Entry Clearance Officer who will decide if a
				second more detailed interview at the Embassy is needed. The Home Office expects most applicants to be able to
				prove they are genuine at the first stage and that this will in fact speed up the decision process on
				applications because fewer documentation checks will be required.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				The student will be asked questions about they chose the UK, the University and their academic programme and how
				this course fits into their career aspirations. They may also be asked about how they plan to fund their
				studies.
			</p>

			<h2 class="my-10 text-xl font-bold text-center text-yellow-600">Credibility Interviews</h2>

			<p>
				Student visa applicants in the UK may be contacted to participate in an interview if there are discrepancies
				between the supporting documents which have been provided and the information included in the visa application
				form, or if the caseworker considering the application requests an interview in order to obtain more information
				before they can make a decision. Failure to attend an interview when invited may result in the students’ visa
				application being refused.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				A transcript of their interview will be included in the information which the caseworker will use to decide the
				students’ application
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				Students can request a copy of their interview transcript and it is recommended that all students do this
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				If the student has previously studied a course which is at the same level as the new course and the student
				received an academic progression justification statement alongside their CAS, they are more likely to be invited
				to an interview. This is because the caseworker is required to assess whether the academic progression
				requirement is met.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				When making this assessment, the caseworker will consider the level of the courses, the subject matter of the
				new and previous courses, the education history, the credibility for the students’ rationale for wishing to
				study the new course, and whether the justification statement sufficiently explains why they are applying to
				study a course at the same level. If a student is invited to an interview, they should be prepared to talk about
				reasons why they want to pursue their course sufficiently.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				The credibility interview is used to assess whether they are "genuine students", i.e. they intend and are able
				to undertake the course for which If a student is asked to an interview but does not attend without a reasonable
				explanation, the application will be refused.
			</p>

			<h3 class="my-6 font-semibold text-center">
				The following list provides some guidance about some of things the interviewing official may consider when
				assessing whether the student is a ‘genuine student’​.​​​​
			</h3>

			<ul class="ml-5 list-disc">
				<li class="my-4">
					The amount of time that has elapsed since the applicant last studied, and whether the applicant has sound
					reasons for returning to, or commencing, formal study in this area, particularly after any significant gap;
				</li>
				<li class="my-4">Whether the applicant demonstrates sufficient commitment to the course;</li>
				<li class="my-4">Whether the course represents academic progression;</li>
				<li class="my-4">
					The credibility of the applicant’s rationale for, knowledge of, and level of research undertaken into, the
					proposed course of study and sponsoring institution, and living arrangements in the UK;
				</li>
				<li class="my-4">What they wrote in their Personal Statement;</li>
				<li class="my-4">The relevance of the course to post-study plans in the UK or overseas;</li>
				<li class="my-4">
					How the circumstances of any dependant may affect the ability or motivation of the applicant to study.
				</li>
				<li class="my-4">The personal and financial circumstances of the applicant and any dependant, for example:</li>
				<li class="my-4">
					The economic circumstances of the applicant and any dependant in their region in their home country;
				</li>
				<li class="my-4">
					Whether the applicant has credible funds to meet course fees, and living costs for themselves and any
					dependents for the duration of the course in a UK city, with limited or no ability to work in the UK;
				</li>
				<li class="my-4">
					How the applicant was able to acquire the necessary funds for course fees, as well as accommodation in a UK
					city and living expenses in a UK city for themselves and any dependant; ⦁ The distance between the applicant’s
					place of study and their proposed accommodation in the UK:
				</li>
				<li class="my-4">
					The distance between the applicant’s place of study and their proposed accommodation in the UK:
				</li>
				<li class="my-4">The average monthly expenditure for the applicant and any dependant in a UK city;</li>
				<li class="my-4">
					The applicant’s personal circumstances, where these would make it difficult to complete a full-time course of
					study.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="my-6">
				If an institution sponsors a child aged under the age of 18 it must keep records of parental/legal guardian
				consent to the arrangements for the child’s application, travel, reception and care arrangements in the UK.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				Children aged 16 and 17 have the legal right to live independently in the UK, and may make their own
				arrangements for accommodation, but they need the consent of parental/legal guardian to do this and to travel to
				the UK (if applying from overseas)
			</p>

			<h2 class="my-10 text-xl font-bold text-center text-yellow-600">
				Institutional Reporting during study circumstances
			</h2>

			<p>
				The table below gives a list of circumstances before or at the course start, which institutions must report to
				the Home Office, and the actions they must take.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				It is vitally important to keep institutions well-informed of any changed circumstances, so that they can be
				correctly reported to the Home Office.
			</p>

			<img
				src="./assets/images/changed-circumstances.png"
				alt="Image of a table with all the changed circumstances"
				class="m-auto my-6"
			/>

			<h2 class="my-10 text-xl font-bold text-center text-yellow-600">During students’ studies</h2>

			<p>
				The Home Office can bring the students’ immigration permission to an end early if they are notified of one of
				these issues.
			</p>

			<h3 class="my-6 font-semibold text-center">Students’ attendance</h3>

			<p class="my-6">
				International students are obliged by the UK Home Office to actively engage with their studies. For students to
				be successful, they need to be present at all expected study and meeting periods. This is also a requirement to
				maintain their visa. Make sure you make students aware of this.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				Attendance monitoring is an important part of protecting their visa status. Attendance and engagement with their
				courses of study are monitored in various ways, to help international students maintain their obligations as
				Tier 4 visa holders.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				Examples of expected contacts include attending formal academic or pastoral care activities including:
			</p>

			<ul class="ml-5 list-disc">
				<li class="my-4">a lesson, lecture, tutorial or seminar</li>
				<li class="my-4">a test, examination or assessment board</li>
				<li class="my-4">a meeting with a supervisor or personal tutor</li>
				<li class="my-4">a research-method or research-panel meeting, writing-up seminars or doctoral workshops</li>
				<li class="my-4">an oral examination (viva)</li>
				<li class="my-4">an appointment with a welfare adviser or international student adviser</li>
				<li class="my-4">
					submitting assessed or unassessed coursework, an interim dissertation, coursework or report
				</li>
				<li class="my-4">registration (for enrolment or matriculation)</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="my-6">There are different ways institutions may record this, for example monitoring may include:</p>

			<ul class="ml-5 list-disc">
				<li class="my-4">monthly check-ins with the international student advice service</li>
				<li class="my-4">monitoring submissions of coursework</li>
				<li class="my-4">sitting of exams, and their results</li>
				<li class="my-4">collation of registers taken at taught sessions</li>
				<li class="my-4">monitoring of authorized and unauthorized absences</li>
				<li class="my-4">liaising with employers for work placement international students</li>
				<li class="my-4">liaising with supervisors of postgraduate research international students</li>
				<li class="my-4">monitoring the log books of postgraduate international students.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="my-6">Institutions must keep records of expected attendance and report 10 missed contact periods.</p>

			<h2 class="my-10 text-xl font-bold text-center bg-yellow-600">
				What must students do if they have an unavoidable absence? (1/2)
			</h2>

			<p>
				Absences from the institution and studies can happen. They don't have to affect an international student's
				enrolment and visa, but it is very important that they tell the institution about it.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				Students <b>MUST</b> inform their institution about any absences and find out how to do this at the start of
				their course. The institution’s aim is always to support their international student community while maintaining
				their sponsor status.
			</p>

			<h2 class="my-10 text-xl font-bold text-center bg-yellow-600">
				What happens when a student must miss or defer their studies? (2/2)
			</h2>

			<p>
				If a student’s personal circumstances make it impossible to attend or hand in work, they must inform the
				institution, their supervisor, course tutor or advisor straightaway. It may be possible to miss a short agreed
				period and then continue.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				If they are no longer able to finish their course within their current Student visa permission, then they may
				have to defer their studies. It is very important to establish how much of the course may be missed as soon as
				possible – is it possible to ‘catch up’ or is it necessary to defer their studies?
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				If a student defers their studies after they have arrived in the UK and is no longer actively studying the
				student’s permission to stay is no longer valid. Institutions must report that the student has deferred within
				10 working days of knowing about it and advise them to leave the UK.
			</p>

			<p class="my-6">
				Once the student is ready to resume their studies, then the institution will have to assign a new CAS and the
				student must reapply for a new visa.
			</p>
